	abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

We review existing surface dynamical probes briefly and illustrate the need for new experimental tools that measure on nanoscale distances and over picosecond timescales. We then describe the helium-3 spin-echo method, which is one such tool, together with the approaches used to describe such measurements and the instrumentation developed to realise its application. The main application of helium-3 spin-echo is the study of surface dynamics, hence we review the approaches which have been established to interpret dynamical data and the signatures for various forms of motion, before going on to summarise the experimental studies to date. We also describe Fourier transform atom spectroscopy, a new method for measuring elastic and resonant scattering that is facilitated by the availability of spin-echo instruments. Finally, we look towards future scientific challenges for the technique.}

	abstract = {The incoherent inelastic scattering cross section of slow neutrons from liquids is calculated using a simple model in which the liquid is assumed to have appreciable short range order in a quasi-crystalline form. Diffusive motion takes place in large discrete jumps, between which the atoms oscillate as in a solid. The model predicts a definite, easily calculable cross section which is not dominated by diffusion effects as when continuous diffusion is assumed, but shows a characteristic variation with angle which could be looked for experimentally. The related pair correlation functions are dominated at small r and t by vibrational effects. Although simple and extreme the model explains several aspects of the observations of Brockhouse and Pope in 1959 and others. A brief discussion of the coherent scattering cross sections for the model is given although explicit formulae are not obtained.}

	title = {Interpretation of surface diffusion data with Langevin simulations: a quantitative assessment},
	abstract = {Diffusion studies of adsorbates moving on a surface are often analyzed using 2D Langevin simulations. These simulations are computationally cheap and offer valuable insight into the dynamics, however, they simplify the complex interactions between the substrate and adsorbate atoms, neglecting correlations in the motion of the two species. The effect of this simplification on the accuracy of observables extracted using Langevin simulations was previously unquantified. Here we report a numerical study aimed at assessing the validity of this approach. We compared experimentally accessible observables which were calculated using a Langevin simulation with those obtained from explicit molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that within the range of parameters we explored Langevin simulations provide a good alternative for calculating the diffusion procress, i.e. the effect of correlations is too small to be observed within the numerical accuracy of this study and most likely would not have a significant effect on the interpretation of experimental data. Our comparison of the two numerical approaches also demonstrates the effect temperature dependent friction has on the calculated observables, illustrating the importance of accounting for such a temperature dependence when interpreting experimental data.}

Resolution is achieved by using the 3He nuclear spin as an internal timer{,} to enable measurement of the energy changes of individual atoms as they scatter. The technique yields a measurement of surface correlation in reciprocal space and real time{,} and probes the nanometre length scales and picosecond to nanosecond timescales that are characteristic of many important atomistic processes. In this article we provide an introductory description of the 3HeSE technique for quasi-elastic scattering measurements and explain how it can be used to obtain unique insights into the motion of adsorbates. We illustrate the technique by reviewing recent measurements{,} starting with simple hopping and then showing how correlations{,} arising from adsorbate interactions{,} can be observed. The final measurements demonstrate how the absence of such correlations{,} when expected{,} are used to question the conventional description that attributes the coverage dependence of surface processes entirely to pairwise forces between adsorbates. The emphasis throughout is on the characteristic signatures of adsorbate motion that can be seen in the data{,} without recourse to a detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations using the Langevin equation are used to illustrate generic behaviour and to provide a quantitative analysis of the experiment."

	abstract = {A molecular dynamics simulation of the diffusion of sodium adatoms on a Cu(001) surface has been performed. A pairwise Morse potential, fitted to the adatom adsorption geometry, binding energy, vibrational frequencies and activation energy for diffusion is used to model the sodium-copper interaction. Good agreement is obtained with quasielastic helium scattering data for the system, confirming the interpretation that sodium diffuses by jumps from one four-fold hollow site to another with an effective activation energy of 51 meV and a jump attempt frequency of 0.53 THz. The measured jump rate is lower than that predicted by transition state theory. The MD simulation suggests that this discrepancy arises because the rate of energy transfer between the adatom and the substrate is so slow that it controls the attempt rate rather than the vibrational frequencies of the adatom as transition state theory would predict.}

In the experimental part the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen by metals is discussed in some detail, and an attempt is made to identify comprehensively the origins of the different excitations observed by various experimentalists. Dissociative chemisorption of small molecules, such as H2O and C6H6, is also covered before the review turns to the physisorption of gases at polar and graphitic surfaces.}

Using the nuclear spins in an atomic beam of 3He we have demonstrated the power of this method, by resolving a change in energy of several neV. Due to the exclusive surface sensitivity and complete inertness of He atoms as a probe, 3He spin echo (3He-SE) seems an ideal method for studying slow motion in and on surfaces (e.g. diffusion). Therefore, we have added UHV surface science capabilities to the 3He-SE setup. We present the first results obtained with the completed apparatus and show that 3He-SE may give information on the dynamics at the surface on length scales up to tens of μm.}
