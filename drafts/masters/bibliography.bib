	journal = {Journal of Physics Communications},
	abstract = {We derive an analytical expression for the intermediate scattering function of a particle on a flat surface obeying the Generalised Langevin equation, with exponential memory friction. Numerical simulations based on an extended phase space method confirm the analytical results. The simulated trajectories provide qualitative insight into the effect that introducing a finite memory timescale has on the analytical line shapes. The relative amplitude of the long-time exponential tail of the line shape is suppressed, but its decay rate is unchanged, reflecting the fact that the cutoff frequency of the exponential kernel affects short-time correlations but not the diffusion coefficient which is defined in terms of a long-time limit. The exponential sensitivity of the relative amplitudes to the decay time of the chosen memory kernel is a very strong indicator for the prospect of inferring a friction kernel and the physical insights from experimentally measured intermediate scattering functions.}

@article{Kubo,
  abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

The package, which accounts for three spatial dimensions and rigid-body like rotation, is tuned to explore surface diffusion of co-adsorbed species. The physical parameters are species specific, and include user-defined colored noise spectra and memory friction kernels acting independently on translational and rotational degrees of freedom. We benchmark the simulations using established analytical results for dynamical correlation functions, and we use the package to numerically verify novel analytical results concerning dissipative rotational motion and multi-exponential friction kernels. The package provides a straight-forward way to expand the modeling of ultra-fast surface diffusion problems at the atomic scale.
  Program summary
  Program title: PIGLE — Particles Interacting in Generalized Langevin Equation simulator Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/759j7vhfgp.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: MATLAB/Simulink Nature of problem: Understanding molecular diffusion at surfaces is of fundamental and industrial interest, and requires bridging between the experiment and ab-initio theories. Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to bridge the experimental and theoretical worlds, however normally surface dynamics simulations are done either under extreme simplifications (two dimensional Langevin with for single species adsorbate), or with all the substrate atoms as well as the adsorbate atoms included explicitly — at expensive computational cost. Solution method: We here present a simulator for generalized Langevin dynamics of co-adsorbed interacting species, accounting for surface diffusion in 3 spatial dimensions and rigid body rotation. The package allows also to perform statistical analysis of the computed trajectories, considering a configuration of scattering centers which is imposed on the translating and rotating center-of-mass.}

We then describe the helium-3 spin-echo method, which is one such tool, together with the approaches used to describe such measurements and the instrumentation developed to realise its application. The main application of helium-3 spin-echo is the study of surface dynamics, hence we review the approaches which have been established to interpret dynamical data and the signatures for various forms of motion, before going on to summarise the experimental studies to date. We also describe Fourier transform atom spectroscopy, a new method for measuring elastic and resonant scattering that is facilitated by the availability of spin-echo instruments. Finally, we look towards future scientific challenges for the technique.}

The unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) method, which provides heats of adsorption and reaction activation barriers with a typical accuracy of 1–3 kcal/mol, emerges as the method with the widest applicability for complex and practically important reaction systems. We discuss in detail the theoretical foundations of the analytic UBI-QEP method which employs the most general two-body interaction potentials. The potential variable, named a bond index, is a general exponential function of the two-center bond distance. The bond indices of interacting bonds are assumed to be conserved at unity (up to the dissociation point), and we cite state-of-the-art ab initio calculations to support this assumption. The UBI-QEP method allows one to calculate the reaction energetics in a straightforward variational way. We summarize the analytic formulas for adsorbate binding energies in various coordination modes and for intrinsic and diffusion activation barriers. We also describe a computer program which makes UBI-QEP calculations fully automated. The normalized bond index-molecular dinamics, (NBI-MD) simulation technique, which is an adaptation of the UBI-QEP reactive potential functions to molecular dynamics, is described. Detailed summaries of applications are given which include the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, oxygen assisted X-H bond cleavage, hydrogen peroxide, methanol and ammonia syntheses, decomposition and reduction of NO, and SOx chemistry.}

The size effect was studied by molecular simulation of a Lennard—Jones fluid mixture adsorbed in zeolite 13X. The molecules forming the binary mixture are non-polar and have a 2.4 ratio of saturation capacities (the same as CCl2F2 and CO2). In the molecular simulation, adsorption occurs on the energetically homogeneous surface of a spherical shell. Binary adsorption is centered on separate shells with the larger molecule in the inner shell. At high coverage, the simulations yield moderate negative deviations from ideal mixing similar to experimental data. Both molecules can enter the cavity, but adsorbed-phase nonidealities are caused by the exclusion of the larger molecule from part of the micropore space accessible to the smaller molecule. The partial exclusion effect is calculated from the cavity radius and molecular diameters of the adsorbate molecules.}

A pairwise Morse potential, fitted to the adatom adsorption geometry, binding energy, vibrational frequencies and activation energy for diffusion is used to model the sodium-copper interaction. Good agreement is obtained with quasielastic helium scattering data for the system, confirming the interpretation that sodium diffuses by jumps from one four-fold hollow site to another with an effective activation energy of 51 meV and a jump attempt frequency of 0.53 THz. The measured jump rate is lower than that predicted by transition state theory. The MD simulation suggests that this discrepancy arises because the rate of energy transfer between the adatom and the substrate is so slow that it controls the attempt rate rather than the vibrational frequencies of the adatom as transition state theory would predict.}

Two representations of the copper surface (2D and 3D) are used to investigate its effect on the adsorption patterns, diffusion constants and activation energies. An interesting result is that the adsorption pattern for Na and K changes when adding layers of substrate (2D → 3D) favouring unusual adsorption sites, which is in agreement with recent theoretical evidence.}

Diffusive motion takes place in large discrete jumps, between which the atoms oscillate as in a solid. The model predicts a definite, easily calculable cross section which is not dominated by diffusion effects as when continuous diffusion is assumed, but shows a characteristic variation with angle which could be looked for experimentally. The related pair correlation functions are dominated at small r and t by vibrational effects. Although simple and extreme the model explains several aspects of the observations of Brockhouse and Pope in 1959 and others. A brief discussion of the coherent scattering cross sections for the model is given although explicit formulae are not obtained.}

The dynamics is simplest when the concentration of adsorbates is sufficiently small that interaction between adsorbates can be ignored. But even for this tracer diffusion process, much remains to be uncovered. Here, we present the interplay between experimental measurement of tracer diffusion and its theoretical interpretation, which leads to good estimates of the interaction of the adparticle with the surface. We show how the results from three different experimental techniques—field ion microscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy and quasielastic helium atom scattering—can be interpreted. Using the generalized Langevin equation as a model for the diffusion dynamics, we show how the turnover theory for activated diffusion may be used to describe the measured time evolution of the adparticle distribution on the surface. The different activation energy measured for hopping over single or double lattice lengths is shown to come from the added energy loss to the surface, as the particle moves over the longer path. We discuss some of the issues which are not yet clear; these include quantum effects, such as the quantum suppression of diffusion, vibrationally assisted diffusion, multidimensional effects and diffusion in the presence of external fields.}

  abstract = {We present an analytic model applied to quasi-elastic scattering from an adsorbed surface species undergoing jump diffusion between adsorption sites described by a Bravais lattice combined with a basis of multiple points. The model allows for hops between adsorption sites which are both symmetrically and energetically inequivalent. We give results for 1-D hopping, which are applicable to a species jumping between the top and bridge sites along the [11̅0] direction on an fcc-(110) surface or for jumps along a step edge. In 2-D, results for hopping between fcc and hcp hollow sites and between the bridge sites of an fcc-(111) surface are presented. These examples give characteristic signatures which will allow these forms of motion to be recognized in experimental data and will enable the underlying physical parameters to be extracted by comparison with the analytical forms derived here.}

  This chapter deals with the phenomenon of heterogeneous catalysis. It begins with a description of concepts that allow the understanding of variations in the reactivity from one surface to the next. These variations are essential to the understanding of heterogeneous catalysis, because they hold the key to distinguishing between a good and a bad catalyst. This chapter exploits the experiment-theory combination to build an understanding of variations in bond energies form one metal to the next. In this regard, it demonstrates that it is through an understanding of these variations, that concepts that allow determining why a particular surface is be a good catalyst for a given reaction, while other surfaces are not, are understood. This chapter also introduces descriptors that can be used to characterize the catalytic properties of a surface. It illustrates how surface bonding and catalytic activity are closely related. One of the main conclusions is that adsorption energies of the main intermediates in a surface catalyzed reaction are often a very good descriptor of the catalytic activity. It also demonstrates that the variation in adsorption energies from one transition metal to the next and the variation from one surface geometrical structure to the next can be understood on the basis of a model describing the coupling between the adsorbate states and the transition metal d states. Finally, it states that theoretical methods need further development with a higher accuracy to describe the finer details including possibly catalyst selectivity.}

  abstract  ="Helium-3 spin-echo (3HeSE) is a powerful{,} new experimental technique for studying dynamical phenomena at surfaces with ultra-high energy resolution. Resolution is achieved by using the 3He nuclear spin as an internal timer{,} to enable measurement of the energy changes of individual atoms as they scatter. The technique yields a measurement of surface correlation in reciprocal space and real time{,} and probes the nanometre length scales and picosecond to nanosecond timescales that are characteristic of many important atomistic processes. In this article we provide an introductory description of the 3HeSE technique for quasi-elastic scattering measurements and explain how it can be used to obtain unique insights into the motion of adsorbates. We illustrate the technique by reviewing recent measurements{,} starting with simple hopping and then showing how correlations{,} arising from adsorbate interactions{,} can be observed. The final measurements demonstrate how the absence of such correlations{,} when expected{,} are used to question the conventional description that attributes the coverage dependence of surface processes entirely to pairwise forces between adsorbates. The emphasis throughout is on the characteristic signatures of adsorbate motion that can be seen in the data{,} without recourse to a detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations using the Langevin equation are used to illustrate generic behaviour and to provide a quantitative analysis of the experiment."
